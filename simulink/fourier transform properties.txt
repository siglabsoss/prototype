1. linearity
2. time shift: a time shift in the time domain is a phase shift in the frequency domain.
3. Time reversal: time reversal is frequency reversal
4. Even and odd: mirror time signals are mirror frequency signals.  Rotation symmetric signals are rotation symmetric in the freq domain.
5. Scaling: increasing the sampling rate in the time domain reduces the resolution in the frequency domain, divides amplitude by same factor
6. Conjugation: the fourier transform of a signal's conjugate is the conjugate of the signal's frequency-reversed fourier transform
7. Duality: the fourier transform of a fourier transform is the original signal, time reversed and amplitude multiplied by 2*pi
8. Multiplication theorem: the integral of the multiplication of a signal and the conjugate of another signal is the integral of the same of the two freq domain representations, scaled by 1/2/pi
